How To Run
1. Open command line
2. Run make command
3. Place file in same folder as executable
4. Run each program by following commands
	- Brute Force Inversions : ./xmain p11 data.txt
	- Brute Force Convex Hull : ./xmain p21 data.txt
	- Divide and Conquer Inversions : ./xmain p12 data.txt
	- Quick Hull: ./xmain p22 data.txt
5. Program prints the results and running time. Note the brute force algorithms take more time as expected so please give a bit of time (~1 mins)
6. Run make clean to remove the executable and object files

NOTE: For p11 and p12 program asks for the number of integers per line since the input files had 5 integers per line. So the user needs to use the same 
number of integers per line to get correct results. Easiest process is using 1 per line.
