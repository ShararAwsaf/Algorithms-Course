In case of shift counts, I am only counting the mismatch shifts not the cases where a match happens

HOW TO RUN
1)  make
2)  ./xmain <required: program name (p11/p12/p21/p22/p23)> <optional: filename> <optional: pattern> [NOTE: The arguments must be in order]
3) if no <filename> is provided, then the default file is ./data/data_4.txt (p11/p12) and ./data/data_5.txt (p21/p22/p23)
4) if no <pattern> is provided, the user is asked to type in a pattern
